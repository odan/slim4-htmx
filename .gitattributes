# Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
# Git will always convert line endings to LF on checkout. You should use 
# this for files that must keep LF endings, even on Windows.

# All the files and directories that can be excluded from dist, 
# we could have a more clean vendor/
#
# So when someone will install that package through with --prefer-dist option, 
# all the files and directories listed in .gitattributes file will be excluded. 
# This could have a big impact on big deployments and/or testing.
